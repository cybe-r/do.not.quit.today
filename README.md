A Social Initiative, Driven by Technology
-----------------------------------------

We all can sense the increasing social pressure around us. It could be peer pressure, academic pressure, professional pressure or socio-economic pressure but it could lead to depression, anxiety and so many other problems if it crosses a certain barrier.

The idea and vision of this project is to give voice to such issues, understand them by listening to those who are facing it and look for solution among ourselves.

There are various ways to raise voice, we're initiating by giving it a web interface.
